Program takes a search term and zero or more files to be searched
Searches each file line by line for occurrences of the passed in term
If a line contains the term the line is printed to the screen, otherwise it is not.
If no term is specified, then we can match no lines are all lines
If no file is specified, we should read from stdin

1) Parse command line arguments
    -We need to check that a search term has been entered, if not we can automatically exit.
    -We need to decide at least one file has been entered, if not default to stdin
    -If no command line arguments are entered we need to return an error message to the caller
